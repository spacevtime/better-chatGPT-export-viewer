# Better Chat Viewer for OpenAI Conversations

This is an improved HTML viewer for OpenAI conversation exports. It basically just adds sidebar navigation and some better styling using Bootstrap 5 to hopefully make reading your exported chats a better experience.

## Features

- Sidebar Navigation: Easily switch between different conversations.
- Bootstrap 5 Styling: A more modern and clean look.

## How to Use

- Export Conversations from OpenAI: Go to OpenAI's platform and export your desired conversations.
- Locate the jsonData in Your Export: This is the data of your conversations.
- Copy & Paste: Open the better-chat-viewer.html file in a text editor and paste your jsonData where indicated.
- Open in Browser: Simply double-click on better-chat-viewer.html to view your conversations in the new format!

## Future Plans

I'm hoping to add a feature that prompts users to upload their export file directly. This will make the process even more seamless! But for now, the copy-paste method should do the trick, and doesn't cause CORS problems - lol.
